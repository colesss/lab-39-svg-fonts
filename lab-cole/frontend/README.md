401 JS --  Lab 37 auth/cookies
===

## Program Instructions
Enter in Command Line
* npm i 
* if polyfills error, run in command line: rm -rf node_modules && npm install (why? I have no idea but it worked)
* npm run watch


## Program Issues
* dotenv issue: NODE_ENV environement variable is undefined


## Program Status
* Turning in something due to time restraint and this lab has the best redux compared to other labs but didn't progress on signin/signout
